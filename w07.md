## Top 10 List of Week 07
1. **[Introduction of Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)**<br>
A brief overview about process categorization, race condition, Peterson's solution and semaphore.

2. **[Race Condition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aF0q7NfwfA)**<br>
An explanation about the concept of race condition with an example of it in a multi-process program.

3. **[Resource Allocation Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VksGXfiK7k)**<br>
A simple explanation about how a Resource Allocation Graph can represent the state of the system. That is, the complete information about all the processes that are holding some resources or waiting for some resources.

4. **[The Critical Section Problem](https://binaryterms.com/critical-section-problem.html)**<br>
A little discussion about the definition of critical section, important properties for implementing critical section and a solution to implement critical section.

5. **[Peterson's Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkm8KZz_eJI)**<br>
A nice explanation about Peterson's Solution for solving Critical Section Problem in detail using an example.

6. **[Semaphore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukM_zzrIeXs)**<br>
An explanation about what a semaphore is, how do they work, also an example in C-language.

7. **[Classical Problems of Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classical-problems-of-synchronization-with-semaphore-solution/)**<br>
A brief overview about classical problems of synchronization along with the solutions to each problem.

8. **[Deadlock, Livestock and Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-starvation-and-livelock/)**<br>
An introduction about what exactly Deadlock, Livelock and Starvation are, what condition that can lead to each of them, also the differences between them.

9. **[Deadlock, Livelock and Starvation Code Implementations](https://www.codejava.net/java-core/concurrency/understanding-deadlock-livelock-and-starvation-with-code-examples-in-java)**<br>
A deeper undertanding about the concepts of Deadlock, Livelock and Starvation through examples in Java.

10. **[Banker's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFVbzLLxfY)**<br>
A detailed explanation about Banker's Algorithm as a deadlock avoidance algorithm along with an example.
