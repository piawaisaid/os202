## Top 10 List of Week 09
1. **[CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)**<br>
A basic introduction to CPU scheduling and various scheduling algorithms.

2. **[CPU Burst and I/O Burst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo&t)**<br>
A brief overview about CPU burst, I/O burst and CPU and I/O burst cycles.

3. **[Scheduling Criteria](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scheduling-criteria-in-an-operating-system)**<br>
A detailed explanation about CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time and response time.

4. **[CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)**<br>
An explanation about various algorithms in CPU scheduling including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round-Robin, Priority-Based and Multilevel Queue.

5. **[Preemptive & Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)**<br>
An overview about preemptive scheduling and non-preemptive scheduling along with key differences between them.

6. **[CPU Bound and I/O Bound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKZrjI74VCk)**<br>
An explanation about CPU bound and I/O bound processes.

7. **[Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)**<br>
An explanation about thread scheduling which involves two boundary scheduling (scheduling of user level threads (ULT) to kernel level threads (KLT) via leightweight process (LWP) by the application developer and scheduling of kernel level threads by the system scheduler to perform different unique OS functions).

8. **[Completely Fair Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scfDOof9pww&t)**<br>
An explanation about Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS) and the basic idea behind this concept.

9. **[Multiprocessor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)**<br>
An explanation about asymmetric multiprocessing and symmetric multiprocessing, processor affinity, load balancing and multicore processors.

10. **[Two State and Five State Process Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW1mSaEnBF0)**<br>
A short explanation about the concept of two state and five state process model.
